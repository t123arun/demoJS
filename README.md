Learn and Practice JS Code

OBJECTIVES COVERED !!

1.1. Fetch and Display API data using async/await.

1.2. Fetching and displaying data from API that incorporates many important JS topics. like Async/Await, Fetch API , Error Handling , DOM Manipulation , Template Literals , Event Listeners , Dynamic Data Updates , Destructuring , Modules (optional).

   Topics Included:
   1. fetch(): Makes an API request.
   2. async/await: Waits for promises to resolve for asynchronous operations.
   3. Error Handling: Handles HTTP errors and catches exceptions with tryâ€¦catch.
   4. Event Listeners: Listens for button clicks to trigger API requests.
   5. DOM Manipulation:
      - Dynamically creates and updates DOM elements (createElement, appendChild).
      - Uses classes and innerHTML for templating.
   6. Template Literals: Interpolates variables into HTML strings.
   7. Destructuring: Extracts properties like id, title, and body from objects.
   8. Functional Programming: Uses .forEach() for iteration and .slice() for limiting data.
   9. Modularity (Optional): If required, you can wrap this code in ES6 modules.

1.3 Enhancements : PAGINATION, SEARCH BAR , LOADING INDICATOR , MODULAR CODE. 

1.4 Advanced API CRUD with Lazy Loading.

   Topics Included : 
   1. Lazy Loading : 
      -use current page to track the current page of posts.
      -appends more posts to the DOM when "Load More" is clicked.
   2. CRUD Operations : 
      -Create new post, 
      -Read fetch posts , 
      -Update edits posts directly, 
      -Delete removes posts
   3. Dynamic Event Handling : event delegation to handle clicks on dynamically added elements.
   4. Error Handling : handle error for network failures and invalid inputs.
   5. Promises and Async/Await : handles asynchronous operations cleanly.
   6. Event Delegation : Avoid attaching multiple event listeners.
   7. State Management : Tracks current pagination state.
