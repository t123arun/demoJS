# Personal Task Manager
Learn and Practice JS Code

OBJECTIVE COVERED !!

This project is comprehensive and allows to touch on all the mentioned topics Core JavaScript Fundamentals and advanced topics (ES6+ Features, DOM manipulation, Browser APIs, Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Advanced JavaScript Concepts) while building a useful and interactive application.

Features:

1.Task Management:
    -Add, edit, and delete tasks.
    -Mark tasks as completed or pending.
    -Filter tasks by status (completed, pending, or all).

2.Categories and Tags:
    -Organize tasks into categories (e.g., Work, Personal).
    -Add tags to tasks for easier filtering.
    -Due Dates and Notifications:

3.Assign due dates to tasks.
    -Notify the user if a task is overdue (using Browser APIs).

4.Persistent Storage:
    -Save tasks in localStorage to persist data across sessions.

5.Dark/Light Mode:
    -Add a toggle for dark and light themes.


JS KEY CONCEPTS COVERED:
    
1.Core JS Fundamentals
    - Basic task operations (add, edit, delete, filter).

2.ES6+ Features
    - Use let, const, template literals, spread/rest operators, destructuring, modules, etc.

3.DOM Manipulation
    - Create, update, and delete tasks dynamically in the DOM.

4.Browser APIs
    - Use localStorage, setTimeout, and Notification API.

5.Functional Programming
    - Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce).

6.Object-Oriented Programming
    - Create a Task class to handle task-related operations.

7.Advance JS Concepts
    - Use Promises, async/await, closures, and modules.
